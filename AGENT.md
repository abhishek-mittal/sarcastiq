# PaisaBarbad — Product Vision & Agent Context

## Identity

**Name:** PaisaBarbad (पैसा बर्बाद)
**Tagline:** "We read the reviews so you don't have to cry later."
**Domain:** PaisaBarbad.com
**Tone:** Sarcastic, brutally honest, irreverent — but never cruel to real users.

## Problem

Indian e-commerce is drowning in fake reviews. Sellers game the system with incentivized ratings, copypasta templates, and review farms. Shoppers waste money trusting manufactured consensus — their paisa gets barbad.

Key stats driving the product:
- ~60-70% of 5-star reviews on Indian platforms show patterns of manipulation
- Review text rarely matches the actual star rating ("good product" → 1★)
- Buyers have no signal to separate genuine feedback from paid noise

## Solution

An AI-powered review aggregator that:

1. **Scrapes** product reviews from Amazon.in, Flipkart, and other Indian e-commerce platforms
2. **Classifies** each review as genuine, suspicious, copypasta, or bribed
3. **Computes a Reality Score™** — the actual quality score after filtering out noise
4. **Generates sarcastic verdicts** — translating corporate-speak into what reviewers actually mean
5. **Delivers a Buy or Cry™ verdict** — the final call: buy it, cry about it, or maybe

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Reality Score™** | 0-5 score computed from genuine review ratio, sentiment, and timing analysis |
| **Buy or Cry™** | Final AI verdict: `buy` / `cry` / `maybe` |
| **Sarcastic Verdict** | One-liner that captures the product's truth in the most entertaining way |
| **What They Say vs What They Mean** | Side-by-side translation of review-speak to reality |
| **Review Flags** | `genuine` · `suspicious` · `copypasta` · `bribed` — every review gets tagged |
| **Seller's Delusion** | The inflated rating the seller shows vs. Reality Score |

## Agent Guidelines

When working on this project:

- **Preserve the sarcastic tone** — every user-facing string should have personality
- **Never water down the honesty** — the whole point is brutal truth
- **Indian context matters** — prices in ₹, platforms are Amazon.in & Flipkart, cultural references are Indian
- **SEO/AEO first** — every page needs proper metadata, structured data potential
- **Static export** — no server required, everything builds to static HTML
- **Light theme** — clean bento grid design with white surfaces and subtle accents
